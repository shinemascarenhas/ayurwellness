Features
Prakriti Classification (Dosha Detection) Users answer a set of questions, and a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) classifies them into one of the Ayurvedic Prakriti types: Kapha, Pitta, Vata, or their combinations (e.g., Vata+Pitta). The model achieves high accuracy and highlights key influencing features for smarter health insights.

Personalized Recommendations Based on the predicted Prakriti, users receive personalized dietary and lifestyle suggestions, as well as targeted Ayurvedic remedies for common health conditions.
